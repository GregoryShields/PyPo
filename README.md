# PyPo


## Intro

This is just a repo for some dudes to mess around and learn Python and Git with.  
Hopefully everyone will feel confident enough to try stuff. We're all here to learn, so it doesn't matter if you do or don't know how to do something.  


## First file

As a starting point, a Python source code file with just a simple print() statement has been created.  
After you clone this repo, you'll also want to have Python 3 installed somewhere somehow.  
Let's rumble!
